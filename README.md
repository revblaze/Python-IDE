Python IDE for iOS is a free, open source project that is my attempt at recreating IDLE for mobile devices. Notice how I said IDLE and not PyCharm or some other advanced IDE. This is my attempt at creating a cost-effective simulation of the Python programming language without the use of external servers/compilers.

## Features
- iPhone and iPad support
- Synthetic interpreter
- Line numbering
- Syntax highlighting
- Automatic file saving
- File sharing of some sort
- We'll add more as we go

## Requirements
- Requires iOS 7.0 or later
